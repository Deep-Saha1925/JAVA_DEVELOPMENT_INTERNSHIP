# Calculator Project

This project is a simple console-based calculator implemented in Java. It provides basic arithmetic operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.

## Features

- **Addition**: Adds two integers.
- **Subtraction**: Subtracts the second integer from the first.
- **Multiplication**: Multiplies two integers.
- **Division**: Divides the first integer by the second, with error handling for division by zero.
- **Modulus**: Computes the remainder of the division of the first integer by the second, with error handling for division by zero.

## Usage

1. Compile the `Calculator.java` file using a Java compiler.
2. Run the compiled class file.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to select an operation and input the required numbers.
4. The result will be displayed in the console.

## Error Handling

- The calculator will throw an `IllegalArgumentException` if an attempt is made to divide by zero in the division or modulus operations.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
